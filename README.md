# plant_app

this app is a plant store UI inspired from 
 "The Flutter Way channel"
 ## [Watch it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/LN668OAUrK4)

### The Change We Made :   
we used models and ListView.builder instead of use a simple list view with children or a SingleChildScrollView
and also share data between the HomeScreen and the DetailsScreen to get better UserExperience while navigate..
