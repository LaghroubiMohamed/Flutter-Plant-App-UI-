# plant_app

this app is a plant store UI inspired from 
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN668OAUrK4&t=52s"
 "The Flutter Way channel"

### The Change We Made :   
we used models and ListView.builder instead of use a simple list view with children or a SingleChildScrollView
and also share data between the HomeScreen and the DetailsScreen to get better UserExperience while navigate..


### Plant App Final UI
